Aternos App (Unofficial)

🚀 Aternos — now as an Android app.
This project turns the Aternos website into a smooth, mobile-friendly Android application, so you can manage your Minecraft servers without constantly opening a browser.

⚠️ This is an unofficial app. It is not affiliated with Aternos GmbH.

📱 What is this?

Aternos already has a powerful web panel, but using it on mobile can feel slow and messy.
So I wrapped the official Aternos website into an Android app to make:

Server control faster

Navigation easier

Mobile usage smoother

Everything feel more “app-like” instead of “website-ish”

No fake APIs.
No modified backend.
It uses the real Aternos website, just inside an app.

🎮 What you can do

Start / stop your Minecraft server

View server status in real-time

Manage players & console

Change server software (Paper, Fabric, Forge, etc.)

Access logs & settings

Log in securely using Aternos’ official login

Basically: everything you normally do on aternos.org — but in one tap.

🛠️ How it works

Built using Android WebView

Loads the official Aternos website

No data scraping

No account data stored

Login happens directly on Aternos

Your account stays 100% yours.

🔐 Security & Privacy

This app does not collect passwords

No trackers

No third-party analytics

All authentication is handled by Aternos itself

If you can log in on the website, you can log in here.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This app is:

Unofficial

Fan-made

Created for convenience and learning purposes

If Aternos ever releases an official app — use that instead 👍

🧠 Why I made this

I use Aternos a lot and got tired of:

Reopening the browser

Losing tabs

Slow mobile navigation

So I made this app to keep server management quick and simple.
