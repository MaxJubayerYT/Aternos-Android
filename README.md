### •📱 What is this?

### •Aternos already has a powerful web panel, but using it on mobile can feel slow and messy. So I wrapped the official Aternos website into an Android app to make:

•Server control faster

•Navigation easier

•Mobile usage smoother

•Everything feel more “app-like” instead of “website-ish”

•No fake APIs.
•No modified backend.
•It uses the real Aternos website, just inside an app.

### •🎮 What you can do

•Start / stop your Minecraft server

•View server status in real-time

•Manage players & console

•Change server software (Paper, Fabric, Forge, etc.)

•Access logs & settings

•Log in securely using Aternos’ official login

•Basically: everything you normally do on aternos.org — but in one tap.

### •🛠️ How it works

•Built using Android WebView

•Loads the official Aternos website

•No data scraping

•No account data stored

•Login happens directly on Aternos

•Your account stays 100% yours.

### 🔐 Security & Privacy

•This app does not collect passwords

•No trackers

•No third-party analytics

•All authentication is handled by Aternos itself

•If you can log in on the website, you can log in here.

### •⚠️ Disclaimer

### This app is:

•Unofficial

•Fan-made

•Created for convenience and learning purposes

•All rights, trademarks, and services belong to Aternos GmbH.

•If Aternos ever releases an official app — use that instead 👍

### •🧠 Why I made this

•I use Aternos a lot and got tired of:

•Reopening the browser

•Losing tabs

•Slow mobile navigation

•So I made this app to keep server management quick and simple.
